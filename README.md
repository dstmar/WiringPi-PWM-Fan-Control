# WiringPi-PWM-Fan-Control
Use WiringPi C library to control a 4-pin PWM fan on Raspberry Pi

Depends on WiringPi - to install on Pi4B, I needed to install v2.52 as v2.50 on the apt repos wasn't compatible :<br/>
wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb<br/>
sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb

If you're going to use the unofficial mirror (https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi) on a Pi4B, some code changes might need to be done to adjust for the new way it handles the 54MHz clock with this commit :<br/>
https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/commit/651136a110d1a63320193d4f7d39e9399762847e

I'm running this on a Pi4B with a Delta ASB0305HP-00CP4 PWM fan.

Helpful guide for the hardware side of wiring a PWM 4-pin fan (also check fan datasheet for required values and resistor for tachometer) :<br/>

<h2>Configuring :</h2>
This is configured to use the WiringPi pin numbering, to see a list of pins, this command will about a little table :<br/>
gpio readall

I haven't built in any kind of config file or arguments for this, so all the settings must be changed in the source.

<b>pwm_pin :</b> GPIO pin (WiringPi numbering) which connects to fan's PWM wire<br/>
<b>pi_freq :</b> Base frequency in Hz of Pi - 54 MHz for Pi4B (19.2MHz for older models)<br/>
<b>pwm_freq :</b> Fan PWM frequency in Hz (see fan datasheet for this value)<br/>
<b>speed_start :</b> Fan speed in % to start fan from dead stop (see fan datasheet for this value)<br/>
<b>speed_min :</b> Minimum fan speed in % (my fan couldn't reliably run under 10% speed)<br/>
<b>speed_max :</b> Maximum fan speed in % (depending on your temp_max, this speed may never get reached)<br/>
<b>temp_min :</b> Temperature in °C to stop fan<br/>
<b>temp_max :</b> Temperature in °C to set fan to speed_max<br/>
<b>temp_start :</b> Don't start fan until this temperature in °C is reached<br/>
<b>tach_pin :</b> GPIO pin (WiringPi numbering) which connects to the tach wire on fan, along with 3.3V with resistor<br/>
<b>tach_pulse :</b> Number of tachometer pulses per fan revolution (see datasheet for this value)<br/>
<b>refresh_time :</b> Seconds to wait between updates<br/>
<b>debug :</b> Set to 1 to print debug message or 0 to run silently

<h2>Compile with :</h2>
gcc -o wpi wpi.c -lwiringPi<br/>
chmod +x wpi

<h2>Run with :</h2>
sudo ./wpi

You can also create a systemd service to launch this as a service on startup.
